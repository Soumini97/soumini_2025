# Summary 
1. I learned how to read code and understand what it does. I also learned about different computer science terms.
2. I am weak on vocabulary questions that ask about a certain type of CSP topics and then ask about benefits and drawbacks. 
3. I mostly made mistakes on simple things like vocabulary mistakes. I learned about cloud-computing software, incremental build, and formal definitions of many topics. Below, I've attached mistakes that I've been able to learn from.
