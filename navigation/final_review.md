## Trimester 3 – Final Sprint

### Illumina Interactive Biotech Projects

#### **1. Trivia Quiz (Bias-Free Learning)**
- **Overview**: Built a dynamic biotech quiz app that queries Gemini via an API prompt and returns JSON-formatted questions and answers.
- **Technical Features**:
  - **API Development** with Flask
  - **Token Authorization** to access Gemini
  - **Frontend-Backend Integration** using async fetch
  - **JSON Parsing** and **DOM manipulation**
  - **CRUD Operations** for local quiz management
  - **Postman Testing** for endpoint verification
- **Skills & Concepts Practiced**:
  - Software Engineering Practices: Planning changes, testing API endpoints, and building help documentation
  - Data Types: JSON objects, arrays, strings
  - Control Structures: Async functions, error handling

#### **2. 10-Year Heart Disease Risk Predictor**
- **Overview**: Combines a machine learning model and Framingham study equation to calculate user health risk.
- **Technical Implementation**:
  - Trained `RandomForestRegressor` on health datasets (Pandas/Numpy)
  - Used a medical formula from literature to verify prediction
  - Final output = Average of ML prediction and formula
- **Skills Gained**:
  - Software Development Lifecycle Practices: Version control, testing, debugging
  - Data Management: Scaling, cleaning, analyzing large CSV datasets
  - ML Concepts: Multi-output regression, model training/testing
  - Operators: Mathematical expressions and boolean logic

### Book Journal – Personal Project
- **Overview**: A full-stack book tracking app. Users can add books with title, author, summary, cover URL, and reactions.
- **Tech Used**: Python (Flask), JavaScript, SQLite
- **Features**:
  - Card-style frontend rendering for each book
  - API-based input forms with CRUD logic
  - Database integration for persistent state
- **Concepts Applied**:
  - Software Engineering Practices: Commented code, modular design
  - API development
  - Used Python, Javascript, and SQLite
  - Classes: Used Python classes for API routes and book objects




## Trimester 2 – Mid-Year Focus

### Bookworms Project
- **Feature**: Random book generator with search bar, comment, and threaded reply sections.
- **Backend**: Flask endpoints with structured routes and conditional queries
- **Frontend**: JavaScript-based interaction, rendered comment sections, and reply logic
- **Skills Developed**:
  - Control Structures: Nested conditions for comment threading
  - Data Types: Arrays and JSON objects for book data
  - Input/Output: Form validation and storage
  - CRUD Operations



## Trimester 1 – Foundation

### Initial Book Project
- **Project**: Frontend-only book app with LocalStorage for reviews and likes
- **Languages**: HTML/CSS/JavaScript
- **Concepts Learned**:
  - Input/Output: HTML forms and DOM elements
  - Control Structures: Loops, if/else, error catching
  - Operators: Math and string manipulation

### Key CS Principles Mastered This Year
- **Data Types**: Numbers, strings, booleans, arrays, JSON, SQLite tables  
- **Operators**: Arithmetic, string operations, boolean logic  
- **Control Structures**: Iteration, conditionals, try/except, `.then()`/`.catch()`  
- **Input/Output**: DOM manipulation, HTML forms, frontend data handling  
- **Classes**: Python class definitions, instantiations, method handling  
- **Software Engineering**: Planning, issues, code comments, building docs  
- **SDLC**: GitHub flow (fork, branch, PR, merge), testing  
- **Retrospective Practices**: Demos, reviews, presenting, reflecting

![Contributions]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/natm3.png)

- **Biotech Trivia Quiz** – real-time API-fed learning tool to teach people about DNA and biotechnology, sourced from Google's Gemini API to reduce creator bias in the questions
- **Disease Risk Predictor** – personalized health analytics tool to help others understand what factors contribute to the risk of stroke and heart disease

### What I Learned:
- How to present technical projects to general audiences  
- Explaining the coding process through documentation
- The importance of visual design and responsiveness
- How to answer questions about backend structure and data flow

### Favorite Project I Saw:
- **Annie – Biology Chatbot** from Period 2  
  - Used voice recognition and AI to explain biotech concepts
  - Showed incredible creativity and user interaction quality
