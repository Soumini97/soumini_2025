## Difficulties:
I had trouble downloading python, ruby, and other bundles. I also had trouble setting up my about me page. 

## Achievements:
I was able to properly download VS code and install all the extensions. I was also able to make edits to my pages, create Jupyter notebooks, and commit and push all my changes to my github page.
