## Popcorn Hack 1
<br>
In my home security system, logic gates are used to control, access, and respond to different inputs, to make sure that only authorized users can enter. For example, in an electronic lock, the system uses a combo of AND and NOT gates to check if the correct password or key is entered. If the inputs match the expected values, the AND gate outputs a signal to unlock the door. If any input is incorrect, the NOT gate will trigger a response, such as sounding an alarm, triggering the police, or keeping the door locked, to prevent people from breaking in. Using logic gates can make sure that the security system is reliable and safe.<br>
