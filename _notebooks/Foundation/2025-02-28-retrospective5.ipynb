    "## My Top Five Accomplishments \n",
    "1) I learned how to create databases with SQLite3 Editor. I became proficient in querying the database to extract python lists, which were in the form of book details and comment details for my feature. I also became proficient in adding and manipulating the data that was added to the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) I learned about how to use CRUD methods. It was crucial for me to understand and use Create, Read, Update, and Delete in order for me to use these methods in my code to manipulate comments for each book. \n",
    "\n",
    "3) I learned about the process of iteration. In my journey, one of the main mistakes I made was making too many changes at a time. It was difficult for me to debug my code whenever I made multiple changes to my code at a time, and I learned how to fix this mistake. Instead of making too many major changes, I made one change, iterated over it, and made another change, which greatly improved the quality of my code. \n",
    "\n",
    "4) I learned a lot about deployment. Through lectures and demos, I learned about different ports, docker commands, AWS deployment, servers. \n",
    "\n",
    "5) My last biggest accomplishment is learning how to collaborate well with my team members. Initially, we had some difficulty in communications and there were some gaps within our feature. However, after recieving feedback, we were able to collaborate as a team to deliver a product that was cohesive and clean. \n",

    "## Collegeboard MCQ Analysis: \n",
    "Between my last MCQ and my current MCQ, I was able to notice a significant improvement in my scores. In trimester 1, my MCQ scores demonstrate a score of 73%, while my Trimester 2 MCQ scores landed at 94%. Personally, I believe this is a huge improvement and really demonstrates my growth over the course of this trimester. \n",
    "\n",
    "1) My Strenths: Answering questions about code logic and program design and development, identifying and correcting errors, binary numbers, extracting information from data, mathematical expressions, all of the Big Idea 3 topics, and calling and developing procedures. \n",
    "\n",
    "2) My Weaknesses: Data compression, developing algorithms, the internet, and data abstraction. I also had difficulty with the timing. On average, most of my questions took around 45 seconds to 1 minute to answer, however I did find myself taking up to five minutes for one or two questions, which can be an issue. \n",
