    "Crowdsourcing is a method of gathering contributions from a large group of people, typically over the internet, to solve problems, generate data, or complete complex tasks. Instead of relying on a small group of experts, crowdsourcing breaks tasks into smaller pieces and distributes them to many participants, making it faster, cheaper, and more diverse."
